# Design a Meeting Scheduler

## Design a meeting scheduler and return the name of the room booked.

## Goals of the system :
	
	* Book a room for the meeting and return the name of the room booked.
	* History of the booked meetings.

- Write an API which accepts a start time and an end time and returns the meeting room name for the booked scheduled time.


# Addtional Task:
	- Extend the application to book meetings across days.
	- You're free to modify the code as per your need. If it suits you, even erase the entire code and write your own from scratch. The only requirement is to schedule the meeting(s) via the API on the given day.
